              My name is Kevin Jerome, and I am a passionate developer with aspirations for being an entrepreneur.
              My early life consisted of a few key things; nickelodeon, video games, and creativity. I spent my days
              carving play-doh, drawing frames for still pictures and/or flipbooks, and writing stories. It wasn't until
              I laid my eyes on programming that I started to see the potential for creating something that could bring my ideas to life.
              I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my phone, before eventually getting a computer, 
              then transitioning to C# to build a video game using Unity, and then finally learning more about 
              tech stacks and further honing my skills in software development.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              I see AI not as a 'job killer', but as an amplifier for those who know what they're doing. AI has played
              a role in most of my most recent work, and I expect it to continue playing a role in amplifying the speed
              in which I can complete my future work. I understand that speed is a very important factor in the game of
              entrepreneurship, and I intend to utilize AI as the accelerator that it is meant to be.
